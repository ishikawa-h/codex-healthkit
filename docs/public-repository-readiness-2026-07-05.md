# Public Repository Readiness 2026-07-05

Target: `codex-healthkit`

Purpose: prepare the repository for a helpful public GitHub launch.

## Sources Checked

Official / guide sources:

- GitHub Community Profile documentation
- Open Source Guides: Starting an Open Source Project
- GitHub issue form documentation
- GitHub security policy documentation

Reference repositories:

- `cli/cli`
- `sharkdp/bat`
- `BurntSushi/ripgrep`
- `denoland/deno`

## Findings

GitHub's community profile expects public projects to expose core community-health files:

- README
- LICENSE
- CONTRIBUTING
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT
- SECURITY
- issue templates

Open Source Guides also recommends that every open source project include:

- license
- README
- contributing guidelines
- code of conduct

Popular CLI repositories tend to:

- keep README as the main entry point
- link to contribution and security docs from README
- provide clear installation and development commands
- keep release history in a changelog or release checklist
- use issue / pull request templates to reduce unclear reports

## Changes Added

Repository health:

- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- `SUPPORT.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `.editorconfig`

GitHub workflow and templates:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/01-bug-report.yml`
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/02-safety-boundary.yml`
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/03-docs-improvement.yml`
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`

User documentation:

- `docs/usage.md`
- `docs/faq.md`
- `docs/release-checklist.md`

README improvements:

- added result interpretation
- added support flow
- added contribution flow
- added documentation links
- linked changelog

## Decision

The repository is now much closer to a normal public OSS repository. It should feel understandable to:

- a first-time user
- a cautious user reviewing privacy risk
- a contributor opening a small pull request
- a person reporting a bug
- a person reporting a security concern

## Completed Public-Launch Steps

- Created the public GitHub repository under `Ishikawa-Hidekazu/codex-healthkit`.
- Pushed `main`.
- Confirmed README clone URL works.
- Confirmed GitHub Community Profile recognizes core public repository files.
- Enabled GitHub private vulnerability reporting.
- Enabled secret scanning and push protection.
- Confirmed public git history uses English commit messages.

## Remaining Alpha Steps

- Run Linux QA before claiming Linux support.
- Decide whether to tag `v0.1.0`.
- Watch first issues carefully and tighten templates if people still paste unsafe output.
